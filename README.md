# File Uploader Project

This project is a simple file upload application built with Node.js, Express, and Multer. It allows users to upload files, with support for size limits and file type validation. Uploaded files are stored on the server, and the application provides feedback on the success or failure of the upload process.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload files through a web interface.
- **File Size Limit**: Only files up to 1 MB are allowed.
- **File Type Validation**: Only PDF files are allowed.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors such as file size limits and invalid file types.
- **Basic File Processing**: (If applicable, describe any processing done on the uploaded files.)
